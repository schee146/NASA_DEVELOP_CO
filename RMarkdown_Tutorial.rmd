## So, You Want to Create an RMarkdown File

Good choice. RMarkdown allows for you to make really nice looking and interactive documents, like this one you are reading. These documents can be loaded as an HTML file through a web browser, or viewed directly in a Github repository.

## What is RMarkdown?

RMarkdown has two main parts: R and Markdown. An RMarkdown document can have any number of blocks of R or Markdown. A more full description of RMarkdown can be found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

### R

R is a coding language mainly used for statistical analysis. It can be used to make nice charts, plots, and tables.

### Markdown

Markdown is a more simple version of HTML. Bascially, it is a way to use plaintext to format rich text like you might see in a Word document. 

## Getting Started

I'm assuming you already have `git` and `RStudio` installed on your computer and `git` is connected to your Github account. The next step is to connect to RStudio.

Create a new repository on Github. This will be used for testing and you will probably delete it later. 

In RStudio, click `File` -> `New Project...`

## R Markdown Stuff

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
